      <div class="content">
        <p>
          <strong>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)</strong> is one of the most commonly used tools for self-assessing mood and recognizing early signs of depression. It consists of a set of questions about your emotions, thoughts, and behaviors over the past few days. By answering honestly, you can get an initial indication of whether it might be helpful to consult a doctor or psychologist. 
          <strong>
            The Beck Test is not intended to provide a diagnosis—it is only a screening tool. A diagnosis of depression can only be made by a qualified specialist.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>⦿ Instructions for completing the test:</p>
        <p>
          For each question, select only one answer that best describes how you have felt during the past 7 days (not just today). If you are unsure, ask yourself: Which answer best reflects what I feel and think?
